# FlaCap
A Python-native toolkit for the geometric analysis and reconstruction of Adeno-associated viruses and Flaviviridae capsids. Implements affine transformation logic to generate high-fidelity biological assemblies, validated using Adeno-associated virus 1 and Dengue Virus Serotype 3 (DENV3) envelope protein data ($T=3$ symmetry).
